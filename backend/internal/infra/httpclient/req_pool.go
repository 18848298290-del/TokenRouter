// req_pool.go caches configured req clients and instruments their HTTP
// requests for dependency timing.
// req clients share connections only when their supplied proxy text, overall
// timeout, Chrome impersonation flag, and force-HTTP/2 flag identify the same
// cache key. Proxy syntax is checked during construction, while the key uses
// trimmed input before SOCKS scheme normalization, so equivalent normalized
// proxies can still have separate entries.
//
// Concurrent misses may build several candidates. LoadOrStore chooses a
// shared client when the stored value has the expected type; an unexpected
// existing value stays stored and the new candidate is returned directly.
// Callers treat returned client configuration as immutable, and transport
// instrumentation is installed during construction before the client can be
// published.

// sharedReqClients caches req clients by construction options.
//
// Clients share their underlying connection pools.
// The key includes proxy, timeout, impersonation, and HTTP/2 settings.
// Concurrent misses may construct multiple candidates.
// LoadOrStore selects the shared instance returned to callers.

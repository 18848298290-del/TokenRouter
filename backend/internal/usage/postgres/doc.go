// Package postgres persists analytical usage records and reads retained reports.
// Acting users, billing users, diagnostic request IDs, and financial deduplication
// keys keep separate meanings across queries; billing transactions establish the
// actual funding outcome recorded for analysis.

//     acknowledgement, duplicate identity recovery, and batch failure handling.

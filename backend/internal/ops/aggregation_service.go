// aggregation_service.go schedules hourly and daily Ops aggregation and
// coordinates each refresh with leadership and shutdown.
// Ops aggregation refreshes the latest stable UTC hour and the latest closed
// UTC day, rather than scanning an entire missing history. Hourly selection
// subtracts a five-minute safety delay before flooring its end, while daily
// selection closes at today's UTC midnight. A saved latest-bucket hint can
// advance the chosen start but cannot extend the default window backward.
//
// Hourly and daily loops progress independently and can run together, with
// separate local mutexes, Redis keys, and database advisory identities. Startup
// runs both immediately; buffered triggers request prompt later work. Stop
// closes the loop signal and joins registered work, but each aggregation
// attempt uses background contexts and continues its own queries and heartbeat
// write. Redis contention skips a run, while Redis failure or absence selects
// the database lock; those separate lock mechanisms do not coordinate with one
// another.

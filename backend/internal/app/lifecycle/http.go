// http.go runs the HTTP listener and coordinates server shutdown when
// application cancellation arrives. HTTP listening can end through a Serve
// error or through application cancellation. The listener is acquired before
// the serving goroutine starts, so address conflicts return directly. A
// buffered result channel lets the serving goroutine publish its final error
// while the caller is shutting down the server after cancellation.
//
// Cancellation starts a fresh five-second shutdown budget independent of the
// cancelled context. A failed graceful shutdown invokes Close, then the caller
// waits for Serve to return before combining errors. ErrServerClosed is the
// expected HTTP termination result. Background service draining belongs to the
// application after this HTTP phase, with its own budget.

// Serve listens at server.Addr and runs HTTP until serving ends or ctx is
// cancelled. Listener acquisition errors return before any serving goroutine
// starts, and ErrServerClosed is treated as expected termination.
//
// Cancellation invokes Shutdown with a separate five-second context, then
// falls back to Close if graceful shutdown fails. It waits for the serving
// result and joins unexpected serve or close errors with shutdown failure.
// Successful cancellation-driven shutdown returns nil; callers perform their
// background drain after this function returns.

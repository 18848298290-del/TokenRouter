// expiry.go runs periodic announcement expiry scans and coordinates worker

// Active announcements become archived when their end time reaches the scan's
// current time. Expiry scans start once immediately and then use a fixed ticker;
// each scan passes a bounded context to the repository and reports failures in
// the log so a later scheduled scan can try the same eligible records again.
//
// Start and Stop share a lifecycle mutex, making worker registration precede
// any shutdown wait. Stop records a terminal state and closes the exit signal
// once, then waits outside the mutex for scans to finish. The stop signal does
// not cancel an in-progress repository call; that call receives its own timeout
// context and must return before Stop can finish.

// budget consumed by the repository, independent of the ticker's configured interval.

/**
 * gatewayPolicyPayload.ts serializes loaded Fast policy rules and platform
 * scheduling thresholds for the administrator bulk update. A policy field that
 * has not loaded remains omitted, allowing another settings tab to save while
 * the server retains its current rules. A loaded policy can deliberately submit
 * an empty rule list, which remains distinct from an unknown configuration.
 *
 * Each rule trims empty model patterns before selecting whitelist-dependent
 * fallback fields. User identifiers are copied, and block messages follow their
 * corresponding action. Scheduling thresholds pass through the API owner's
 * sanitizer after policy construction, retaining its platform-specific optional
 * field rules in the final request object.

/**
 * buildGatewayPolicyPayload returns known Fast policy fields and sanitized
 * scheduling thresholds for the bulk settings request. Call it after domain
 * validation so shared draft values already reflect accepted control input.
 * An unloaded policy is omitted; a loaded empty list is serialized as empty.
 * Whitelist-dependent fallback fields are included when nonempty model patterns
 * remain, and their error message is included when the fallback action blocks.
 * User identifiers are copied so the request cannot share the draft selection array.
